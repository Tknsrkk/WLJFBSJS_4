# exercise

## P11
a.Yes, because Bob uses non persistent HTTP parallel instances and has more connections, he can get more link bandwidth.<br>
b.Yes, Bob still needs to perform parallel downloads; otherwise, he will get less bandwidth than the other four users.

	
## P7
Elapsed time: RTT0 + RTT1 + ... + RTTn

## P9
a.  
Δ=850000/15000000 = 0.0567 s  

β=16  
βΔ=16\*0.0567=0.907  

average access delay:0.0567/(1-0.907)=0.61 s  
total reponse time:3+0.61=3.61 s

b.
average access delay:0.0567/(1-0.6\*0.907)=0.124 s  

total reponse time:0.4\*0+0.6\*(3+0.124)=1.87s
